# How to test a Flutter app

[How to test a Flutter app](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-app-testing) | Flutter Codelabs

In this codelab, you'll build and test a simple Flutter app. The app will use the Provider package 
  for managing state.

## What you'll learn

- How to create widget tests using the widget testing framework
- How to create an integration test to test the app's UI and performance using the integration_test library
- How to test data classes (providers) with the help of unit tests

## What you'll build

In this codelab, you'll start by building a simple application with a list of items. We provide the source code for you so you can get right to the testing. The app supports the following operations:

- Adding the items to favorites
- Viewing the list of favorites
- Removing items from the favorites list


Once the app is complete, you will write the following tests:

- Unit tests to validate the add and remove operations
- Widgets tests for the home and favorites pages
- UI and performance tests for the entire app using integration tests
